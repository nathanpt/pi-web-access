# Capabilities

How `fetch_content` and the providers handle specific content types. Every path has a fallback chain — see [How It Works](#how-it-works) below for the full routing diagram.

## GitHub repos

GitHub URLs are cloned locally instead of scraped. The agent gets real file contents and a local path to explore with `read` and `bash`. Root URLs return the repo tree + README, `/tree/` paths return directory listings, `/blob/` paths return file contents.

Repos over 350MB get a lightweight API-based view instead of a full clone (override with `forceClone: true`). Commit SHA URLs are handled via the API. Clones are cached for the session and wiped on session change. Private repos require the `gh` CLI.

## YouTube videos

YouTube URLs are processed via Gemini for full video understanding — visual descriptions, transcripts with timestamps, and chapter markers. Pass a `prompt` to ask specific questions about the video. Results include the video thumbnail so the agent gets visual context alongside the transcript.

Fallback: Gemini Web when browser cookies are enabled → Gemini API → Perplexity (text summary only). Handles all URL formats: `/watch?v=`, `youtu.be/`, `/shorts/`, `/live/`, `/embed/`, `/v/`.

## Local video files

Pass a file path (`/`, `./`, `../`, or `file://` prefix) to analyze video content via Gemini. Supports MP4, MOV, WebM, AVI, and other common formats up to 50MB. Pass a `prompt` to ask about specific content. If ffmpeg is installed, a thumbnail frame is included alongside the analysis.

Fallback: Gemini API (Files API upload) → Gemini Web when browser cookies are enabled.

## Video frame extraction

Use `timestamp` and/or `frames` on any YouTube URL or local video file to extract visual frames as images.

```typescript
fetch_content({ url: "...", timestamp: "23:41" })                       // single frame
fetch_content({ url: "...", timestamp: "23:41-25:00" })                 // range, 6 frames
fetch_content({ url: "...", timestamp: "23:41-25:00", frames: 3 })      // range, custom count
fetch_content({ url: "...", timestamp: "23:41", frames: 5 })            // 5 frames at 5s intervals
fetch_content({ url: "...", frames: 6 })                                // sample whole video
```

Requires `ffmpeg` (and `yt-dlp` for YouTube). Timestamps accept `H:MM:SS`, `MM:SS`, or bare seconds.

## PDFs

PDF URLs are extracted as text and saved to `~/Downloads/` as markdown. The agent can then `read` specific sections without loading the full document into context. Text-based extraction only — no OCR.

## Blocked pages

When Readability fails or returns only a cookie notice, the extension retries via Jina Reader (handles JS rendering server-side, no API key needed), then Olostep scrape (when an Olostep API key is configured — a server-side renderer returning clean markdown), then Parallel Extract (when a Parallel API key is configured — a server-side renderer that also handles PDFs), then Gemini URL Context API, then Gemini Web extraction when browser cookies are enabled. Handles SPAs, JS-heavy pages, and anti-bot protections transparently. Also parses Next.js RSC flight data when present.

## How It Works

```
web_search(query)
  → Exa (direct API with key, MCP without) → Perplexity → Gemini API → Gemini Web (if browser cookies enabled) → Parallel (last-resort fallback if keyed)

fetch_content(url)
  → Video file?  Gemini API (Files API) → Gemini Web (if browser cookies enabled)
  → GitHub URL?  Clone repo, return file contents + local path
  → YouTube URL? Gemini Web (if browser cookies enabled) → Gemini API → Perplexity
  → HTTP fetch → PDF? Extract text, save to ~/Downloads/
               → HTML? Readability → RSC parser → Jina Reader → Olostep scrape (if keyed) → Parallel Extract (if keyed) → Gemini fallback
               → Text/JSON/Markdown? Return directly
```
